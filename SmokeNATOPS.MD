This Manual is published under the authority of the

This manual supercedes all previous written or oral rules for Smoke.

1.	This game shall be played by no more than seven players.
2.	The dealer will deal five cards to each player.
3.	The dealer will turn his last card and this becomes Smoke (trump).
4.	Each player, beginning to the left of the dealer, can discard any or all of his cards and be given new cards.
5.	However, each player has -the choice to sit out a maximum of two hands in a row. (Exception: any player who has a score of three or less is a must player ie: in the hole)
6.	After everyone has sat out or received new cards, the dealer shows the top and bottom cards of the ones remaining.
7.	The dealer must lead his highest smoke; if the dealer folds, player to his left leads his high smoke.
8.	Players must follow suit, if able, and tricks are taken as in bridge.
9.	Each player starts with 10 points and the object of the game is to get to zero. Each trick taken subtracts one point. However, anyone playing and not taking a trick, gets 5 points added to his score.
10.	The official scorekeeper maintains scores and must announce must players (those who have sat out twice in a row and those in the hole).
11.	Talking among players is not only allowed, but is encouraged. This is done particularly to get low score or "hole" players elevated five points.
